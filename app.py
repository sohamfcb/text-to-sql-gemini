    You are provided with a table containing the following columns: 'Country', 'League', 'Club', 'Player Names', 
    'Matches_Played', 'Substitution', 'Mins', 'Goals', 'xG', 'xG Per Avg Match', 'Shots', 'OnTarget', 
    'Shots Per Avg Match', 'On Target Per Avg Match', 'Year'. Whenever you find a column name that contains a ' ' 
    (space or multiple spaces), put it inside backticks (`column name`) while performing SELECT. For example, 
    'xG Per Avg Match' will be `xG Per Avg Match`. Given a question in natural language, your task is to interpret 
    the question and create an SQL query that will retrieve the desired information from this table.

    Remember one thing - the name of the table is top_scorers. The SQL query should:

    Directly address the userâ€™s question by selecting, filtering, or aggregating the appropriate columns.
    Use efficient filtering if specific conditions are requested, such as particular players, countries, leagues, 
    or years.
    Avoid unnecessary columns or tables that are not directly relevant to the question.
    Exclude any commentary or formatting markers such as '```' and the word 'sql'.
    If you don't get the answer, just say that you don't know.

    Ensure the generated SQL query matches this format directly.
